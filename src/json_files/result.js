  intro: "I know what you are thinking... Where is the timeline? Here is the hard truth: estimating exactly when you'll know enough to get a job is really, really hard. Learning to code is not like baking a cake. You can't set a timer and wait for that coding cake to come out the oven. There are so many variables to learning: your level of prior experience, the depth of that prior experience, time available for learning, efficiency in that available time, rate at which you learn concepts of varying difficulty, rate at which you work through projects of varying difficulty, etc, etc, etc... It's better to focus on learning well than it is to focus on learning fast.",
  tips: {
    tip1: "Pick one learning resource and stick with it",
    tip2: "Find a community of learners.",
    tip3: "Be consistent. This means coding every day, even if it is for a few minutes.",
    tip4: "Find joy in the learning process. Progress is hard if all you think about is the prize.",
    tip5: "Don't compare your current skills or learning pace to others. Everyone has different things going on in their life."
